Creating a microsite for showcasing my experience and interest in working at Buzzvel involves several steps.

First clone the project repository

git clone https://github.com/lucasspratcus/Buzzvel

To run this project you need to Install the dependencies:

cd your-project-directory
npx create-next-app@latest
npm install next react react-dom
npm install gsap
npm install classnames

Then run the project:

npm run dev

With this, the project is ready, comprising all the necessary requirements. It is composed of the components Navbar, LandingPage, AboutMe, ProjectsSlideshow and footer.

The Live project can be found at:
