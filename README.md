ðŸ’» Creating a microsite for showcasing my experience and interest in working at Buzzvel involves several steps.

Technology Stack:

+ Frontend Framework: Next.js and React.js
+ Styling: CSS Modules, GSAP for animations
+ Hosting Platforms: Vercel (for optimized Next.js deployment)

First clone the project repository:

```shell
  git clone https://github.com/lucasspratcus/Buzzvel
```
To run this project you need to Install the dependencies:

+ cd your-project-directory
+ npx create-next-app@latest
+ npm install next react react-dom
+ npm install gsap
+ npm install classnames

Then run the project:

npm run dev

With this, the project is ready, comprising all the necessary requirements. It is composed of the components Navbar, LandingPage, AboutMe, ProjectsSlideshow and footer.
